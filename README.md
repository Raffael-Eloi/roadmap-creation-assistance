## The history behind it

The roadmap idea came up when I was helping my wife improve her career as a software engineer. At the time, I used Notion to organize the sequence of activities and her study plan. The main problem we faced was the repetitive activity of switching tabs between GitHub and Notion, as well as the lack of organization and progress tracking on the GitHub side.

After spending some time working with GitHub, I was introduced to the concepts of milestones and projects. At that point, I migrated all the organization, documentation, and structure from Notion to GitHub.

The improved organization and progress tracking had a positive effect on her perception, and that’s when I knew the job was done.

Using this structure made me realize that I could automate it and help others improve their careers as well. That’s the story behind this repo.

## Goal

Help people improve their careers in the software engineering field.

The goal is to develop thinkers with strong foundational knowledge, a critical mindset, openness to tools and concepts, attention to detail, solid principles, and a strong commitment to software quality and architecture.

## Structure of the Roadmap

This roadmap is a summary of my journey as a software engineer so far.

The structure consists of:

- Milestones - Big picture goals (e.g. Programming Languages & Execution Model Fundamentals)

- Issues - Tasks, practical or theorical activeties related to the milestone (e.g. [TECH] Draw a diagram of the .NET execution flow)

The issues are divided into three categories:

- [TECH] — Technical implementation

- [ME] Mindset Evolution — Reflection and reasoning

- [HO] Hands-On — Small practical challenges / POCs

## How it works

1 – Buy credits on the OpenAI API

Go to the OpenAI API website, purchase some credits, and generate an OpenAI API key.

2 – Create a personal access token on GitHub

You need to create a personal access token in your GitHub account.

Currently, these are the steps to create it on GitHub:

Profile → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic) → Generate new token → Generate new token (classic)

Select the following scopes:
- repo
- admin:org
- project

3 - Create a repository on GitHub

4 - Create a short description of your project domain
Example: CRUD of cars

The project itself can be very simple. The difference comes from the details, practices, and fundamentals applied around the project, which shape the roadmap.

Summary
To create the roadmap, you need to send the following information in the request model:
- GitHub owner (your GitHub username)
- GitHub repository name
- GitHub token
- OpenAI API key
- API domain definition (the short project description)
